              <p class="process-paragraph firstpara">In the Material and Design course at SIAT, we had to create a functioning home object while taking design concepts from an existing design firm in a team of two. This home object had to either
                explore an
                aspect of conceptual time, a lighting experience or an audio product. For this project, I was in charge of the design aspect of the physical product while my partner had worked on the internal mechanics. Melontime, is a conceptual
                timepiece for the home that works as a 30 second timer by rocking back and forth with visual light cues that signify the user of what it is currently doing. We started the project with sketching out the idea, ideating what we could
                do.

              <p class="process-paragraph">We generally found what we wanted to do, creating a house piece that conceptually tells time by being a 30 second timer. This timer would rock back and forth until the duration is over.
                In this sketch we have a half-cylinder type object which would be the starting point and first sketch of melontime.</p>

              </h2>
              <p class="process-paragraph firstpara">The first problem was iterating on the shape. The curvature of the sides affected the overall feel of the object. A steep curve would make it easier to rock but harder to balance while a shallow
                curve would be harder to rock but easier to balance. To figure this out we had made several different mock-ups made out of MDF lasercut pieces. This material allowed us to iterate and test with ease as it is very quick to produce. We
                decided to choose a more equal curvature as it rocked the best.

            <div>
              <p class="process-paragraph"> Along with the shape we also had to decide what material would be best for the bottom round part that melontime would rock on. We tested these different patterns into lasercut MDF to test the durability
                and smoothness that each would offer.</p>

            <div>
              <p class="process-paragraph"> We eventually strayed from these choices as we knew that this material is not what we wanted our piece to communicate. The problem with this material, even if we were to coat it with veneer is that
                it would have felt cheap to the user. The color of the material was also quite dull and not in the image that we had decided for melontime. Although the positives of this material was how interesting the material would bend depending
                on the different patterns that were cut into it. This exploration of materials however lead to us deciding to 3D-print the rounded bottom. </p>

              </h2>
              <p class="process-paragraph firstpara">Once the shape was determined, I decided on the materials. The rounded sides were made of 3D printed PLA Plastic, as itâ€™s a robust material while offering us a smooth texture. We had cut them in
                half as the 3D printers we had access to were not big enough to house the entirety of the piece, and so we had to join the two in the middle. The two remaining
                sides are made of cherry wood, as the hardwood made it fit in within a homespace. The top was an abstract layout of three different acrylic plastics, which were bright enough to glow by themselves. Beneath the acrylic was a thin piece
                of opaque
                plastic which diffused the light from inside when Melontime was switched on.</p>

            <div>
              <p class="process-paragraph">To cut the sides out of cherry-wood we had to 3D model the piece we wanted to be CAD cut printed into our desired shape. After it was cut we also treated the cherry wood by sanding it and using a wax to
                treat the wood. This gave melontime the glossy and smooth wooden sides that communicate the joy of melontime.</p>

                materials and textures from now on. The importance of the materials and textures affect the function and meaning of the product, the feeling that the users get from the product as well.
